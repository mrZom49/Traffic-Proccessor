## Fork changes

This is a personal fork of the [main project](https://github.com/SWP-Team-46/Traffic-Proccessor) that explores a different direction. Instead of scanning a container with a container, it is a container that scans the machines whole network

- [Documentation](/docs) will not be maintained or updated
- No new [reports](/reports) will be made
- Project will no longer follow AGILE and no deadlines will be set
- *Other changes here*

## Access the Product

The easiest way to try the current version is to run the fully containerised stack:

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on the target system.
- Ports **38080** (CNSS web dashboard).

### Deployment Steps

Backend host:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/SWP-Team-46/Traffic-Proccessor.git
cd Traffic-Proccessor/src

# Start backend services
make backend
```

Target host (host running the container to monitor):

```bash
# Attach Traffic Processor to the target container
make attach TARGET=<container-name> \
CNSS_URL=http://<backend-ip>:38080/load
```

Verify deployment:

```bash
docker ps
curl http://<backend-ip>:38080/root
```

Open the dashboard:

```
http://<backend-ip>:38080/static/index.html
```

### Stopping the System

Stop the Traffic Processor:

```bash
make detach
```

Stop backend services:

```bash
make stop
```
